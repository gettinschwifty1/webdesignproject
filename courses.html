                        the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) who can respond to someone who has suddenly
                        collapsed. A cardiac first responder plays a critical role in keeping a person alive until the
                        commencement of expert medical care.

                    <h3>First Aid Responder Course</h3>
                    <p>
                        PHECC has designed the First Aid Response (FAR) Standard to offer appropriate training to
                        individuals and groups who require a first aid skill set including cardiac first response. This standard
                        is designed to meet first aid and basic life support (BLS) requirements that a person known as “First
                        Aid Responder” may encounter. The FAR Standard meets the Health and Safety Authority (HSA)
                        requirement for occupational first aid training for the workplace. The Child and Family Agency
                        (TUSLA) guidance also recognises FAR as the standard for child care

                    <p>
                        In addition to basic life support cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillation
                        skills, the emergency first responder possesses defined skills in the further assessment and
                        management of common medical emergencies and trauma, including common paediatric
